googatlas-mnemosyne
===================


GOOGATLAS MNEMOSYNE is...

a software (still in development) emulating Aby Warburg's "Atlas Mnemosyne" using modern Big Data coming from Wikipedia.

Please treat it as a tribute to Warburg's Work and an exercise in using Web.py (library for Python) combined with BeautifulSoup (library for web parsing for Python).

All files in this repository are open-source.
