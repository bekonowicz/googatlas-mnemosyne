googatlas-mnemosyne
===================


GOOGATLAS MNEMOSYNE is...

a software (still in development) emulating Aby Warburg's "Atlas Mnemosyne" using modern Big Data coming from Wikipedia.

Please treat it as a tribute to Warburg's Work and an exercise in using Web.py (library for Python) combined with BeautifulSoup (library for web parsing for Python).

Source files coming soon (all Python 2.7.5).

All files in this repository are open-source.
